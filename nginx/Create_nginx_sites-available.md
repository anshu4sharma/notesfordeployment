### How to create sites-available and sites-enabled directories on nginx
#
- To Get Access via SSH
```sh
Syntax:- ssh -p PORT USERNAME@HOSTIP
Example:- ssh -p 22 raj@216.32.44.12
```
- Create Two Directories
```sh
cd /etc/nginx
sudo mkdir sites-available sites-enabled
```
- Configure sites-enabled inside nginx.conf File
```sh
cd /etc/nginx
sudo nano nginx.conf
#Add below line inside http block at bottom
include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
```
- Test Nginx Config
```sh
sudo nginx -t
```
- Restart Nginx
```sh
sudo service nginx restart
```
#### You can also create default server configuration inside sites-available (optional)
- Create default file inside sites-available
```sh
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
sudo nano default
```
- Paste below code inside default file. This file's code may change in future. It depends on Nginx.
```sh
# You should look at the following URL's in order to grasp a solid understanding
# of Nginx configuration files in order to fully unleash the power of Nginx.
# http://wiki.nginx.org/Pitfalls
# http://wiki.nginx.org/QuickStart
# http://wiki.nginx.org/Configuration
#
# Generally, you will want to move this file somewhere, and start with a clean
# file but keep this around for reference. Or just disable in sites-enabled.
#
# Please see /usr/share/doc/nginx-doc/examples/ for more detailed examples.

# Default server configuration
#
server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        # SSL configuration
        #
        # listen 443 ssl default_server;
        # listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;
        #
        # Note: You should disable gzip for SSL traffic.
        # See: https://bugs.debian.org/773332
        #
        # Read up on ssl_ciphers to ensure a secure configuration.
        # See: https://bugs.debian.org/765782
        #
        # Self signed certs generated by the ssl-cert package
        # Don't use them in a production server!
        #
        # include snippets/snakeoil.conf;

        root /var/www/html;

        # Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name _;

        location / {
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
                # proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
                # proxy_http_version 1.1;
                # proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                # proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                # proxy_set_header Host $host;
                # proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }

        # pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on 127.0.0.1:9000
        #
        #location ~ \.php$ {
        #       include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        #
        #       # With php7.0-cgi alone:
        #       fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        #       # With php7.0-fpm:
        #       fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
        #}

        # deny access to .htaccess files, if Apache's document root
        # concurs with nginx's one
        #
        #location ~ /\.ht {
        #       deny all;
        #}
}


# Virtual Host configuration for example.com
#
# You can move that to a different file under sites-available/ and symlink that
# to sites-enabled/ to enable it.
#
#server {
#       listen 80;
#       listen [::]:80;
#
#       server_name example.com;
#
#       root /var/www/example.com;
#       index index.html;
#
#       location / {
#               try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
#       }
#}
```
- Now create symbolic link for default file
```sh
cd /etc/nginx
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```
- Test Nginx Config
```sh
sudo nginx -t
```
- Restart Nginx
```sh
sudo service nginx restart
```
